R Libraries Parser is a front-end web application that helps you extract R package installation commands from R scripts. You can quickly identify the packages used in your R script and generate a single `install.packages` command for all of them. Please note that no scripts pasted into this application are sent over the internet.

Try the web app: [R Libraries Parser](https://harshanal.github.io/r-libraries-parser/)

## Features

- **Easy to Use:** Simply paste your R script, click "Find," and copy the generated command to install the necessary packages.
